# CaseStudy_RandomForest

## Summary

Random forest is an ensemble machine learning technique that averages several decision trees on different parts of the same training set, with the objective of overcoming the overfitting problem of the individual decision trees.

In other words, a random forest algorithm is used for both classification and regression problem statements that operate by constructing a lot of decision trees at training time.

Random Forest is one of the most popular and widely used machine learning algorithms for classification problems. It can also be used for the regression problem statements but it mainly performs well on the classification model.

It has become a lethal weapon for modern data scientists to refine the predictive model. The best part of the algorithm is that there are very few assumptions attached to it so data preparation is less challenging which results in time-saving. Itâ€™s listed as a top algorithm (with ensembling) that is popular among the Kaggle Competitions.

## About the Dataset

This dataset contains information of users in a social network. Those informations are the user id the gender the age and the estimated salary. A car company has just launched their brand new luxury SUV. And we're trying to see which of these users of the social network are going to buy this brand new SUV And the last column here tells If yes or no the user bought this SUV we are going to build a model that is going to predict if a user is going to buy or not the SUV based on two variables which are going to be the age and the estimated salary. So our matrix of feature is only going to be these two columns. We want to find some correlations between the age and the estimated salary of a user and his decision to purchase yes or no the SUV.
